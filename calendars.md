![Our School Calendar Service]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ChichesterHarbour.jpeg "Dusk at Cobnor Point, West Sussex, England")


Perspex Cloud offer a School Calendar Service.

We first developed this product for our personal use, to help decipher the school term dates of our children when planning family holidays. It has been so useful, we thought we should share it.

For a small annual fee, we offer schools a shareable calendar that parents and students can subscribe to. This makes the lives of your customers easier because they can instantly see the school term dates and holidays alongside their personal calendars. They will thank you for it.

We will maintain your organisation's calendar and keep it up to date with term dates, bank holidays, day start and end times and anomaly days (such as inset days) as soon as the information becomes available.

At Perspex Cloud, we specialise in solutions that work up-front and carry on working. Our calendars do just that.
