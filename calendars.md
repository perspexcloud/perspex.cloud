![Our Calendar Service]({{ site.baseurl }}/img/ChichesterHarbour.jpeg "Dusk at Cobnor Point, West Sussex, England")


Perspex Cloud are excited to announce their new calendar service.


For a small annual fee, we offer educational establishments, such as schools, a shareable calendar that parents and students can subscribe to. This makes planning your lives much easier because you can instantly see when the school term dates and holidays are, going out into the future.

We will maintain this calendar for you and keep it up to date with term dates, day start and end times and anomaly days (such as inset days) as soon as the information becomes available.

At Perspex Cloud, we specialise in solutions that work up-front and carry on working. Our calendars do just that.

[Contact us](mailto:info@perspex.cloud) for more information.
